<summary>backstory</summary>
<br>

Started building websites with WordPress in 2014 — spent 7 years deep in that ecosystem doing custom themes, plugins, and client work. Eventually hit the ceiling and made the jump to React and TypeScript. That opened the door to real frontend architecture, API design, and eventually systems-level work with Rust.

The name "sandybridge" comes from Intel's Sandy Bridge CPU architecture (2011). Needed an online handle around the same time it launched, and it stuck — games, Discord, GitHub, everywhere since.

Now I spend most of my time in the terminal, building tools and tinkering with infrastructure. The site at [sandybridge.io](https://sandybridge.io) is the living version of all of this.
